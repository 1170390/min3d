  * Added Multi-texture support, including customizable glTexEnvx() parameters, necessitating change to the API in terms of Object3d setup. See updated sample project for usage details.
    # Bitmaps must now be added through the new TextureManager before textures can be assigned to Object3d's.
    # Added TextureVo class, which contains texture-related properties.
    # Object3d's now contain a textures() list, to which TextureVo's are added.
    # For now, multiple textures used by an Object3d are limited to using the same UvBufferList (U/V texture coordinates list). To allow separate textures to use separate texture coordinate lists will require some unfortunate structural changes and changes to the API.

  * sampleProject1 has a new example demonstrating the multi-texture feature. Project has been refactored for the above changes. 

  * Current featureset seems to work as consistently on Android v1.5 emulator as on Nexus One hardware running Android v2.1.
	
  * Fixed spelling of frustum and vertices throughout project. Any class names and identifiers using the incorrect spelling of these two words have been changed.

  * VertexInfo class has been renamed MeshData

  * Scene now resets onSurfaceCreate (i.e., not only on startup, but when Activity resumes after losing focus)

  * Misc changes to API, not too major. Other adjustments to plumbing.

  * Committed a fairly complete sample project of framework usage examples to SVN in /trunk/sampleProjects/min3dSampleProject1. Could be fairly useful. Added executable apk file of it to Downloads.
